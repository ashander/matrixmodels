## Development instructions 

Edit and add new functions in the files in the R/ directory. 
For conceptually separable sets of functions, add a new file. 

For best results use Hadley Wickham's `devtools`. Note you must also install `roxygen2`. 

`install.packages('devtools')`
`load(devtools)`

For common tasks, etc, see the [devtools github page](https://github.com/hadley/devtools)
